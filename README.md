# ToDo List Demo

This app demonstrates a basic ToDo List using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

Items can be added via the text box, and can be removed by clicking on them from the list.

Items that are clicked on will be shown as crossed-out, and then fade away, and finally disappear.

If an item is clicked on again while it is fading, it will be restored and will not disappear.
